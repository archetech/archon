This section contains basic instructions to familiarize you with the use of Archon's Keymaster WebUI.

The Keymaster WebUI is a client interface to the Archon Keymaster library. The web UI is not intended to be a commercial wallet; it is a reference implementation of an Archon wallet offering a web (React) user interface.

Wallet creation and Archon key operations are performed client-side. The server-side is running an Archon Gatekeeper server, which exposes the Keymaster WebUI server components on port `4224`.

When operating a local Archon node, the Archon Keymaster WebUI is available at http://localhost:4224/
