# DIDComm Messaging Support — Design Document

## Problem

Archon agents can already encrypt, sign, and exchange data with each other (Dmail,
Notices, encrypted assets, verifiable credentials), but every one of these is an
Archon-specific format. There is no standards-based, interoperable way for an Archon
agent to message — or be messaged by — an agent built on a different stack.

[DIDComm Messaging v2](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/) (DIF)
is the de-facto standard for transport-agnostic, end-to-end-encrypted, DID-addressed
messaging. Supporting it would let Archon identities participate in the wider SSI
ecosystem (Credo-TS/Aries, Veramo, mobile wallets) and would give us a principled
protocol layer to carry credential issuance and presentation.

This document records the research behind DIDComm, how it lines up with Archon's
existing `did:cid` machinery, the key design decisions, and a phased plan to add support.

## Background: what DIDComm is

The mental model: resolve a DID → read its `keyAgreement` key and `DIDCommMessaging`
service endpoint → pack an encrypted (and optionally signed) envelope → deliver it,
directly or through mediators.

DIDComm defines three nested **envelope** formats:

| Envelope | Format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Plaintext** | JWM (JSON) | The message itself: `id`, `type`, `from`, `to`, `thid`/`pthid` (threading), `created_time`, `expires_time`, `body`, `attachments` |
| **Signed** | JWS | Non-repudiable sender authentication (used selectively) |
| **Encrypted** | JWE | The normal wire format — **anoncrypt** (ECDH-ES, anonymous sender) or **authcrypt** (ECDH-1PU, authenticated sender) |

On top of the envelopes sit **application protocols**, each identified by the message
`type` URI: Trust Ping, Discover Features, Basic Message, Out-of-Band invitations,
Coordinate-Mediation (routing), and the credential protocols (Issue-Credential /
Present-Proof).

### Cryptographic requirements

| Operation | Algorithms | Curves |
|---|---|---|
| Key agreement (encryption) | `ECDH-ES+A256KW` (anoncrypt), `ECDH-1PU+A256KW` (authcrypt) | **MUST**: X25519, P-256, P-384 · *optional*: P-521 |
| Content encryption | `A256CBC-HS512` (required), `A256GCM`, `XC20P` | — |
| Signing | `EdDSA`, `ES256`, `ES256K` | Ed25519, P-256, **secp256k1** |

## The secp256k1 constraint (drives the whole design)

Archon is **secp256k1 end-to-end**: verification methods, `EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019`
proofs, and the existing JWE in [packages/cipher](../packages/cipher/) all use secp256k1.

DIDComm treats the two operations differently:

- ✅ **Signing** — `ES256K` (secp256k1) **is** an approved JWS algorithm. Archon's
  existing keys can sign DIDComm messages and be verified by compliant agents as-is.
- ⚠️ **Encryption** — secp256k1 is **not** an approved key-agreement curve. Encrypted
  DIDComm requires an **X25519, P-256, or P-384** key. Each Archon agent that wants to
  receive encrypted DIDComm must publish a new **key-agreement key** in its DID document.

Adding standard-curve key agreement is therefore the single largest piece of work, and
it is the prerequisite for everything past the signing-only case.

## Current Archon capabilities (reuse surface)

The codebase is well-positioned — much of the machinery exists already:

| DIDComm need | Already in Archon | Location |
|---|---|---|
| JWE (ECDH-ES + A256GCM) | `buildJweCompact` / pack-unpack | [packages/cipher/src/jwe.ts](../packages/cipher/src/jwe.ts) |
| Concat KDF (RFC 7518) | implemented | [packages/cipher/src/concat-kdf.ts](../packages/cipher/src/concat-kdf.ts) |
| Encrypt/decrypt to a DID | `encryptMessage` / `decryptMessage` | [packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts) |
| Sign + verify | `addProof` / `verifyProof` | [packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts) |
| Service endpoints in DID docs | `service[]`; `publishAddress`/`publishLightning` write them | [packages/gatekeeper/src/types.ts](../packages/gatekeeper/src/types.ts), [keymaster.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts) |
| A messaging + notification layer | **Dmail** + **Notices** | [packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts), [types.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/types.ts) |
| HTTP transport + client | Express APIs + axios `KeymasterClient` | [services/keymaster/server/src/keymaster-api.ts](../services/keymaster/server/src/keymaster-api.ts), [keymaster-client.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/keymaster-client.ts) |
| Connection/proof handshake | `createChallenge`/`createResponse`/`verifyResponse` | [packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts) |
| Verifiable Credentials | W3C VC issue/verify | [packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/keymaster.ts) |

### Gaps

1. ~~**Standard-curve key agreement** (X25519) keys + DID-doc `keyAgreement` entries.~~
   *Done in Phase 1.*
2. **ECDH-1PU (authcrypt)** and **key-wrapping** (`...+A256KW`) — today's JWE uses direct
   ECDH-ES, not the wrapped/multi-recipient form DIDComm requires. *To build in `cipher`
   (Phase 2a).*
3. **The DIDComm envelope pack/unpack** (JWM plaintext, signed JWS, the specific
   encrypted-JWE shape with `kid`-addressed recipients). *To build in `cipher` (Phase 2a).*
4. **A `DIDCommMessaging` service endpoint** type + an inbound message receiver.
5. **A DID resolver that emits standard-shaped DID documents** so non-Archon agents can
   resolve `did:cid` (cross-ecosystem interop).
6. **Application protocols** + optional **mediator/routing**.

## Design decisions

**A. Build the crypto, or use a library? → Build it, pure-JS, by extending
[packages/cipher](../packages/cipher/).** DIDComm's primary target here is **in-browser
self-custody wallets** (react-wallet, browser-extension), which hold keys locally and so
must pack/unpack *client-side*. The audited SICPA library
([`didcomm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/didcomm)) is Rust→WASM — and while WASM runs
in browsers, *nothing in DIDComm requires it*: every primitive is standard and already
available pure-JS via `@noble`. Buying the library only saves us writing the envelope
code, in exchange for per-bundler WASM wiring (Vite **and** Webpack), async init, a few
hundred KB of bundle, and an MV3 `wasm-unsafe-eval` CSP allowance — all concentrated in
the browser path we care most about. Extending `cipher` instead runs identically in Node
and the browser (exactly as `cipher` does today, with zero WASM). The cost is owning
three well-specified primitives — **ECDH-1PU**, **AES Key Wrap (A256KW)**, and
**A256CBC-HS512** — plus the JWE/JWS/JWM framing, on top of the ECDH-ES + Concat-KDF + JWE
scaffolding `cipher` already has. Correctness risk is contained by **interop-testing
against `didcomm-node`** (kept as a dev/test oracle, never a runtime dependency): our
`pack` must `unpack` under the library and vice-versa.

*(Revised from the original "use the SICPA library" decision once in-browser
self-custody was confirmed as the primary use case. The Phase 0 spike proved the library
works; the runtime is pure-JS, and interop is now locked in by committed cross-language
test vectors rather than a live oracle.)*

**B. Which key-agreement curve? → X25519.** Mandatory-to-support, smallest/fastest, best
supported across implementations. Derive it deterministically from the existing wallet
seed (a new key index) so it needs no separate backup.

**C. Does DIDComm replace Dmail? → No, additive.** Dmail/Notices is a working internal
product; DIDComm is the *interop* layer. Re-expressing Dmail as a DIDComm protocol is a
possible future, out of scope for v1.

**D. Where does the inbound endpoint live?** A new lightweight `didcomm` service (mirrors
the `services/*` pattern) keeps concerns separate; alternatively extend **Drawbridge**
(already the public-facing gateway, with Tor). Recommend a dedicated service, revisiting
if Tor-based delivery is wanted early.

## Architecture

   • anoncrypt ECDH-ES / authcrypt ECDH-1PU, + A256KW       • resolveDID(sender) to verify
   ▼                                                          authcrypt / JWS

```

Responsibilities split along the existing `cipher` ↔ `keymaster` line (the same split as
`encryptMessage` today):

- **`cipher`** (pure-JS, runs in browser + node) owns the **envelope crypto** on raw JWKs:
  build/parse the JWM plaintext, the JWS sign/verify layer, and the JWE (anoncrypt
  ECDH-ES / authcrypt ECDH-1PU, A256KW key-wrap, A256CBC-HS512 content encryption). No DID
  or wallet knowledge.
- **`keymaster`** orchestrates: resolve the recipient DID → its X25519 `keyAgreement`
  public JWK; derive the agent's own X25519 (and secp256k1 signing) keys from the wallet;
  call `cipher` to pack; on unpack, resolve the *sender's* DID to verify authcrypt/JWS.
  Private keys never leave the process holding the wallet — in a self-custody browser
  wallet, that's the browser.
- **`didcomm-node`** is used only in tests as an **interop oracle** to prove our envelopes
  are spec-compliant; it is not shipped.

## Phased implementation plan

**Phase 0 — Spike & decisions. ✅ done.** Validated `didcomm-node` against Archon-shaped
DIDs carrying X25519 keys (anoncrypt/authcrypt/`ES256K`-sign all round-trip); confirmed
X25519 works and secp256k1 signs as-is. Locked decisions A–D (A later revised to *build*).
The throwaway spike has since been removed; interop is held by committed cross-language
vectors in the cipher/keymaster and Python test suites (JS-produced envelopes that must
decrypt in Python, and vice-versa).

**Phase 1 — Standard-curve keys. ✅ done.** Deterministic X25519 derivation on a dedicated
HD branch (`m/44'/0'/{account}'/1/0`); `publishDidComm`/`unpublishDidComm` write/remove a
`keyAgreement` verification method (+ optional `DIDCommMessaging` service) via `updateDID`.
`cipher.generateX25519Jwk` + OKP JWK types; `DidCidDocument` gains `keyAgreement`. Wired
through interface/client/API. *Exit met:* resolved DID docs carry a valid X25519
`keyAgreement` key.

**Phase 2 — Envelope crypto (build) + pack/unpack API. ✅ done.** Two sub-steps:

- **2a — `cipher` envelope crypto (pure-JS).** Add the three missing primitives —
  **ECDH-1PU**, **AES Key Wrap (A256KW)**, **A256CBC-HS512** — plus JWE general/
  multi-recipient serialization, the JWS layer, and the JWM plaintext, as pure functions
  over raw JWKs (building on the existing ECDH-ES + Concat-KDF + JWE code). Unit-test each
  primitive **and interop-test against `didcomm-node`** (our `pack` → lib `unpack`, and the
  reverse) for spec-compliance.
- **2b — `keymaster` orchestration.** `packDidComm()` / `unpackDidComm()` that resolve the
  recipient (and, on unpack, sender) DID, derive the agent's keys, and call `cipher`. Add
  to the [`KeymasterInterface`](../packages/keymaster/src/types.ts),
  [client](../packages/keymaster/src/keymaster-client.ts), and REST routes. Because the
  crypto is pure-JS in `cipher`, this works unchanged in the browser-shared Keymaster core.

*Exit met:* `cipher.packDidCommMessage`/`unpackEncrypted`/`signJws` + keymaster
`packDidComm`/`unpackDidComm` (interface/client/API). anoncrypt + authcrypt + signed
round-trips between two real `did:cid` identities, unit-tested **and** interop-validated
against `didcomm-node` both directions. `DIDCommMessaging` service type + publish/unpublish
also landed in Phase 1.

**Requirement — cross-method interop.** Archon must exchange DIDComm with agents using
*other* DID methods (`did:key`, `did:web`, `did:peer`, …), not just `did:cid`. This rules
out any Archon-internal delivery shortcut (a foreign agent can't read our gatekeeper) and
mandates standard HTTP transport + multi-method DID resolution. The Phase 2 envelopes are
already spec-standard, so only resolution and transport are method-specific.

**Phase 3 — Cross-method + transport.** Split into:

- **3a — Multi-method resolution + foreign-key normalization. ✅ done.** `cipher`:
  `didKeyToX25519` (resolves `did:key` — `z6LS…` X25519 and `z6Mk…` Ed25519 with the
  spec-correct Ed25519→X25519 derivation, verified against the W3C vector) and
  `normalizeX25519PublicKey` (accepts `publicKeyJwk` **or** `publicKeyMultibase`).
  `keymaster.resolveDidForDidComm` resolves `did:key` locally and routes everything else
  through the gatekeeper (which has a universal-resolver fallback for `did:web` etc.);
  `pack`/`unpack` use it for recipient and sender keys. *Validated:* Archon `did:cid` ↔
  `did:key` both directions (keymaster e2e), and our pack to a `did:key` is unpacked by the
  reference `didcomm-node`. *Caveats:* foreign **signing** interop needs `EdDSA` verify
  (we only verify `ES256K` today); some ecosystems use **P-256** key agreement (cipher is
  X25519-only) — both additive later. For *others* to resolve `did:cid`, Archon needs a
  Universal Resolver driver (separate work).
- **3b — Transport (mailbox). ✅ done.** New `services/didcomm/server` store-and-forward
  relay: `POST /api/v1/messages` stores an envelope by recipient DID (parsed from the JWE
  recipient kids); `GET /api/v1/challenge` + `POST /api/v1/messages/fetch` lets a recipient
  prove DID control with a single-use **signed challenge** (ES256K over the nonce, verified
  via gatekeeper resolution) and retrieve its queue; `messages/remove` acks. keymaster
  `sendDidComm` (pack → resolve the recipient's `DIDCommMessaging` endpoint → POST) and
  `receiveDidComm` (challenge → sign → fetch → unpack → ack), wired through
  interface/client/API. In-memory store with TTL by default, or a **redis** backend (native
  key expiry) via `ARCHON_DIDCOMM_DB`, both behind the async `MailboxStore` interface (mongo
  can be added the same way). *Validated:* core logic unit tests (incl. the redis store
  against a live redis) + an e2e where two Archon identities exchange authcrypt/signed
  messages through the live relay over HTTP, with a forged fetch rejected. Dockerized
  (`docker/Dockerfile.didcomm` + the opt-in `didcomm` compose profile, port 4236).
  **Drawbridge** (the public gateway, with Tor) reverse-proxies `/didcomm` → the internal
  relay, so the published `DIDCommMessaging` endpoint is `<drawbridge public host>/didcomm`
  (or `.onion`) rather than the relay being exposed directly.
- **3c — Forward/routing. ✅ done.** `cipher` `wrapForward` (anoncrypt a `routing/2.0/forward`
  JWM whose `body.next` is the recipient and `attachments[0].data.json` is the inner envelope,
  to the mediator's key) and `parseForward`, both interop-validated against `didcomm-node`
  (`wrap_in_forward`/Forward parsing) in each direction. Integration: the DID-doc
  `serviceEndpoint` object form carries `routingKeys` (`publishDidComm(endpoint, name,
  routingKeys)`); `sendDidComm` wraps in a Forward to the mediator when the recipient
  advertises one; `mediateDidComm` lets an Archon identity act as a mediator — fetch Forwards
  from its mailbox, unpack, and relay the inner envelope to `next`. *Validated:* an e2e where
  Alice → mediator → Bob is delivered via the Forward protocol through the live relay.

*Exit:* a self-custody recipient receives and unpacks a message delivered to its published
endpoint, including from a non-Archon agent.

**Phase 4 — Core protocols. ✅ done.** Trust Ping, Discover Features, Basic Message, and
Out-of-Band invitation message builders (`packages/keymaster/src/didcomm-protocols.ts`,
re-exported from `@didcid/keymaster`), with the exact `didcomm.org` type URIs and body
shapes (verified against the spec) + `_oob` URL encode/decode. They compose with
`sendDidComm`/`receiveDidComm`. *Validated:* builder-shape unit tests + an e2e where Alice
sends a Basic Message and a Trust Ping over the live relay and Bob returns a thid-correlated
ping-response.

**Phase 5 — Credential protocols. ✅ done.** Issue-Credential 3.0 and Present-Proof 3.0
message builders (`didcomm-protocols.ts`) carry an Archon verifiable credential/presentation
as a DIDComm attachment (`data.json`), mapped onto the existing
`bindCredential`/`addProof`/`verifyProof`. *Validated:* an e2e where Alice issues a signed VC
to Bob over DIDComm (Bob verifies the issuer proof), then Carol requests a presentation, Bob
presents a VP wrapping the VC, and Carol verifies both the holder and issuer signatures.
*Note:* full cross-agent interop is bounded by the credential format — Archon VCs use
`EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019`, so interop with Aries/AnonCreds agents needs a standard
attachment format (follow-on).

**Phase 6 — Routing/mediation. ✅ done.** Forward messages landed early in Phase 3c
(`wrapForward`/`parseForward`, `sendDidComm` wrapping, `mediateDidComm`). Coordinate-Mediation
2.0 adds the enrollment handshake: builders for `mediate-request`/`mediate-grant`
(`routing_did`)/`mediate-deny`/`keylist-update`(+response)/`keylist-query`/`keylist`, plus
`routing_did` (bare-DID) routing support in `sendDidComm`. *Validated:* an e2e where Bob
requests mediation, the mediator grants its `routing_did` and acknowledges a keylist-update,
Bob re-publishes advertising it, and Alice then reaches Bob through the mediator. *Note:* the
mediator currently relays any Forward it can unpack; gating relay on the registered keylist
is a refinement.

**Phase 7 — Parity & polish. ✅ done.** The full DIDComm surface is now reachable from every
client tier, not just the in-process `Keymaster` class:

- **CLI (all three)** — the `publish-/unpublish-/pack-/unpack-/send-/receive-/mediate-didcomm`
  commands now exist in parity across [cli.ts](../packages/keymaster/src/cli.ts),
  [scripts/archon-cli.js](../scripts/archon-cli.js), and
  [python/keymaster cli.py](../python/keymaster/src/keymaster/cli.py) (per AGENTS.md's CLI-parity
  rule). `pack`/`send` take the plaintext as a JSON file and a comma-separated recipient list,
  with `--sign`, `--anoncrypt`, `--encryption`, and `--name` (sender identity) flags.
- **Python SDK** ([python/keymaster_sdk](../python/keymaster_sdk/)) — `publish_didcomm` …
  `mediate_didcomm`, mirroring the JS `KeymasterClient` (same REST endpoints/bodies). A mocked
  contract test asserts endpoint + body + return parity for all seven; a live test does a real
  authcrypt pack→unpack round-trip between two identities.
- **Python keymaster library** ([python/keymaster](../python/keymaster/)) — a full pure-Python
  port of the envelope crypto (`didcomm_crypto.py`: X25519, ECDH-ES/1PU+A256KW with the
  tag-in-Concat-KDF, A256CBC-HS512/XC20P/A256GCM, ES256K JWS, did:key, Forward), the protocol
  builders (`didcomm_protocols.py`), and the Keymaster methods, using `cryptography`/`coincurve`
  — XChaCha20-Poly1305 (XC20P) and the Ed25519→X25519 did:key map are implemented inline, with
  **no PyNaCl** (removed to clear a moderate libsodium Dependency-Review advisory). **Validated
  byte-for-byte against the TypeScript stack in both directions** — committed tests decrypt/verify
  JS-produced envelope vectors (JS→PY) and Python round-trips were confirmed to unpack in
  `didcomm-node` (PY→JS) during development.
- **REST + Swagger** were already shipped alongside the transport work (`/didcomm/publish`,
  `/pack`, `/unpack`, `/send`, `/receive`, `/mediate`).

**Phase 8 — Outbound delivery through the service (Tor egress). ✅ done.** Sends no longer dial
recipients from the keymaster — **all outbound delivery goes through the DIDComm service**, which
is the single egress point (and the only component with Tor access). The split:

- *keymaster = crypto* — `sendDidComm`/`send_didcomm` pack, resolve the recipient, Forward-wrap
  for mediated recipients, then hand the **sealed envelope + destination URL** to the gateway.
  The egress is reached at **`<nodeURL>/didcomm`** (Drawbridge's `/didcomm` proxy), **derived from
  the single node URL the keymaster already uses** (`gatekeeper.url`) — exactly as
  `publishLightning` derives its endpoint. There is **no dedicated config / env var**: the keymaster
  knows only its node URL, never the relay directly.
- *didcomm service = transport* — `POST /api/v1/deliver` (reached via Drawbridge's `/didcomm`
  mount, which already proxies it; authenticated by a **signed challenge** proving the sender
  controls a DID; SSRF-guarded — clearnet must be https + non-private) delivers the opaque envelope
  to `<endpoint>/api/v1/messages`, dialing `.onion` over a SOCKS5 Tor proxy (`fetch-socks` →
  `ARCHON_DIDCOMM_TOR_PROXY`, default `tor:9050`, the lightning-mediator pattern).

A node URL is **required** — `sendDidComm` with no gateway to reach is a hard error; there is **no
direct-dial fallback**. (As with Lightning, sends work only when the keymaster's node URL is the
gateway/Drawbridge, not a bare gatekeeper.) This lets the CLI and in-browser wallet reach `.onion`
recipients (they delegate transport) and keeps the keymaster free of network egress. *Validated:*
the relay e2e routes every send through `/deliver`; a unit test asserts the no-gateway hard error.
Privacy: the service sees recipient DIDs + timing, not content. (`ARCHON_DIDCOMM_ALLOW_PRIVATE_EGRESS=true`
permits loopback destinations for dev/test.)

**Reading your own mailbox uses the same local gateway.** `receiveDidComm`/`mediateDidComm`
(challenge → fetch → unpack → ack) connect to **`<nodeURL>/didcomm`** as well — *not* the identity's
published `DIDCommMessaging` endpoint. That published endpoint is for *others sending to you* and may
be a `.onion`; dialing it from the client to read your own mailbox would route out through Tor to reach
your own relay (and fails outright on a client with no Tor — the original symptom). All three operations
now share one derivation (`didcommGatewayBase` / `_didcomm_gateway_base`); an explicit `--endpoint` still
overrides for ad-hoc use.

## Risks & open questions

- **Cross-ecosystem resolution.** External agents must resolve `did:cid`. Archon-to-Archon
  is fine; broad interop needs a Universal Resolver driver for the method — scope early if
  external interop is a goal rather than internal-only.
- **Curve migration UX.** Existing identities predate key-agreement keys; need a clean
  "enable DIDComm on this ID" upgrade path (a DID-doc update, not a re-issuance).
- **We own the envelope crypto** (ECDH-1PU, A256KW, A256CBC-HS512) rather than reusing an
  audited library. Mitigated by interop-testing every mode against `didcomm-node` in both
  directions, and by reusing `cipher`'s existing ECDH-ES/Concat-KDF/JWE code. Subtle spots:
  Concat-KDF inputs for 1PU, the protected-header AAD binding, and exact base64url framing.
- **Authcrypt vs. signed semantics.** Choose per-protocol defaults deliberately; DIDComm
  favours authcrypt over signed-then-encrypted for repudiability.

## Status & next step

against the `didcomm-node` reference library.

| 5 — Credential exchange | ✅ | Issue-Credential 3.0 + Present-Proof 3.0 builders carrying an Archon VC/VP as a DIDComm attachment; maps onto `bindCredential`/`addProof`/`verifyProof`; e2e: Alice issues a VC to Bob over DIDComm (Bob verifies the issuer proof), Carol requests + Bob presents a VP, Carol verifies holder + issuer signatures |

**Remaining (not started):** none. Follow-ons (nice-to-have, not blocking):
EdDSA signature verify (foreign Ed25519 signers), P-256 key agreement, a Universal Resolver
driver so others can resolve `did:cid`, an optional mongo mailbox backend, and a standard
credential attachment format for cross-agent (non-Archon) VC interop (Archon VCs use
`EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019`).
